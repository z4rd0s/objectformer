# Data Generation

Since it is inconvenient to share the malicious data publicly, we share the tools to generate them.

We adopt an inpainting model [EdgeConnect](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect) and the tool from [RGB-N](https://github.com/LarryJiang134/Image_manipulation_detection). You can refer to the original repos to know how to use them.
